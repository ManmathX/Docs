/// warning | Important
This page only covers how to translate the Discord bot.  
If you would like to translate these docs, head over to the [Translate the docs](translate-docs.md) page.

\*Purr* is available in various languages.  
Each of those languages was made with :heart:, effort and some letters by the community.

If you would like to translate the bot into a language that doesn't exist for the bot yet, or want to help improve an existing language, follow this basic guide to find out how you can do that.

## Step 1: Join the Discord Server { #step-1 }
You have to join the [~Nya Discord Server][discord] first because it is the main place for getting notified about new Strings that need to be translated.  
Leaving the Discord as a translator will result in you being removed from the Translation Project!

## Step 2: Request being added { #step-2 }
Once on the Discord Server should you contact `andre601` to request getting added as a Translator.  
Just tell him what language you want to translate.

/// info | New Language
If the language you want to translate doesn't exist on the project yet, will it be created by Andre and you can move on to the [next step](#step-3).
///

## Step 3: Join the Crowdin Project { #step-3 }
The translation Project is hosted on [Crowdin] which you can also find under the following URL: https://lang.purrbot.site

Once you got added to the Discord as a Translator can you now send a request to the project to get added.  
You first need to either login to or create your account on Crowdin. Then select the language you want to translate the bot into. You should see a `Join` button with which you can send a request to get added.  
When everything goes well will you be added.

## You're done! { #done }
Congratulations! If you followed all of the above steps are you now a translator for the bot and can start translating her messages to your language.

/// warning | Important notes
If your language isn't translated for a longer time and without any reason from you, will it be removed from the Project and you will be removed as a translator.
