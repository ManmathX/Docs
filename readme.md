# PurrBot Documentation Overview 📚

Welcome to the PurrBot Documentation! This repository serves as the comprehensive source for the *Purr* Wiki and ImageAPI documentation.

## Key Features ✨

- **Documentation Format**: Our content is crafted in Markdown and built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for a seamless reading experience.

## Contributing 🤝

We welcome contributions! Please refer to our `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for guidelines on how to get involved. Additionally, you can find formatting assistance within the documentation itself.

## Build Previews 🔍

To enhance collaboration, we have implemented a custom workflow that generates previews of pull requests. This setup is inspired by the workflow used in the [win11React](https://github.com/blueedgetechno/win11React) project.
